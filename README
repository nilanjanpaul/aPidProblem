<This> is a test bench application for the PID controller.

1. Constructs and inits a PID object

2. Set PID gain values from given inputs

3. Iterates over PID kernal with given set point and plant values

4. In lieu of a unit test, the test bench uses an assert values passed in from the prompt and checks against the final plant value.

DETAILS
=======

Application is written in C++ and compiled / executed on a "freshly installed" Ubuntu 18.04 hosted on Windows 10 Pro WSL2 platform.

Operating system used:
  Distributor ID: Ubuntu

  home> sudo apt update
  home> sudo apt install emacs g++ build-essential libboost-all-dev

If other dependcencies are required, identify the package and install using 'apt install'

Clone the cpp_pid_problem source directory.

  home> git clone https://github.com/nilanjanpaul/aPidProblem.git
  
Compile the source to build the executable and locate the application:

  cpp_pid_problem> make -j 4
  cpp_pid_problem> ls

Look for the 'build' directory with an executable 'my_pid_app' under it. 

USAGE
=====

From your current directory, run the application with --help. This is will list the allowed options and give you an example usage with the correct options.

  cpp_pid_problem> ./build/my_pid_app --help

Run the application:

  cpp_pid_problem> ./build/my_pid_app --kp 0.125 --ki 0.25 --kd .0625 --sv 4.2 --iter 80 --assert_value 4.2
  
Run the test:

  cpp_pid_problem> make test1
  cpp_pid_problem> make test2
  cpp_pid_problem> make test3
